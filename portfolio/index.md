The cathedral was built on your sacred ground, its stones laid over ancient altars, its hymns drowning out the old rites. 

Writhing inside are only, divine parasites that twisted the very air.

Now the Last Penitent comes, a blind zealot armed with the very corruption they call faith. Let them try to stop you from reclaiming your land. 

Their god is just another beast to slay.
